    <h1>About me:</h1>
    <img src="kusu.jpg"500" height="400">
      <p>Hi, My name is Kush Vapiwala, I am 14 years old and live in Dublin, CA. I am currently an Emerald High school freshman, part of the graduating class of 2027.</p>
    <h2>Career Goal:</h2>
    <p>  Racecar driver, police officer, astronaut, doctor, these are all career options we have looked up to and ranted about as children. However as I continue to grow up, I have a desire to be a software engineer in the field of computer science. If I were to choose a specific company to work at, I'd love to work at Cisco, as its where my father works, and he is my biggest inspiration. Here are my plans to acheive this goal: Graduate Highschool and get accepted into a good college that specializes in computer studies, an example of this would be MIT or Irvine. I would then work for a bachelors degree, specialize for software engineering and major in Computer Science. Hopefully then, I could be hired by a major tech company with the needed requirments accquired and work as an software engineer. Companies that would exceed my expectation would be Google, Amazon, Tesla, however the goal to reach is Cisco. I want to be a software engineer primarily because of my father. My father is a software engineer for Cisco, and I take great inspiration from him, infact he is my greatest inspiration. However, I find software engineering really interesting and I just love coding in general, I love the process of writing code, testing, making changes, till you get a finished product. The sense of acheivement after every failed attempt is just a great feeling to hold. Hence, my final choice that I am now dedicated to acheiving, become a software engineer.</p>
  <h2>Strengths, Qualities, Abilities, & Work Skills: </h2>
  <p>I have several skills and qualities that are necessary to be an exemplary software engineer. One of the most important qualities is my ability to work well in a team. I am open-minded, listen to people's ideas, and can implement and take influence from others. My best application of this skill would be my 2024 DEDA Entrepreneurship Project in which I effectively communicated with my team and stayed connected and made sure everyone was at an agreement to ultimately create a unique and creative program to compete in this competition. Additionally, I am very versatile. While my primary focus is software and coding, I am capable of working with hardware, designing, creating user interfaces, making portfolios, and making code user-friendly by adding notes for better understanding. These are just a few of the skills necessary to be a good software engineer. </p>
  <h2>Important Achievments:</h2>
  <p>Here are some major accomplishments I have made throughout the time I have spent in highschool. Starting off with my biggest personal achievment, Working on the 2024 DEDA Entrepreneurship Project. This is where I best applied my programming skills to create an app that a user can input an ingredient and recieve a recipe that contains their ingredients. I am most proud of this accomplishment since it was my biggest project, and that I also learned how to use flask during this project in order to create a web UI. Aditionally, My personal achievements outside of computer scienes include recieving a PVSA(Presidents Volunteering Service Award), Multiple Honor Roll Certificates throughout my high school career, and certificates of Athletic Excellence(I play tennis).  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion: </h2>
  <p>To remind you once again, my name is Kush and I am part of the Emerald High graduating class of 2027, I have a desire to become a software engineer. Thank you for taking your time for reading my portfolio and hope that you see me as an experience coder and programmer who has a chance of becoming a software engineer. Now that you have gotten to know me, feel free to explore the rest of my website! Enjoy!</p>
